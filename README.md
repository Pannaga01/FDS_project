## Introduction
The pandemic has necessitated online education and remote work and has led to students as well as professionals to explore more in the tech field. Machine learning and Data Science have become the “buzz” words. But almost everyone might have confusion on which platform to begin with, which algorithm to learn in short where to start. Hence we have visualised the data from previous year and compared the data with 2021 to get an in-depth knowledge on various tools and algorithms that might have seen a rise or fall in its popularity in 2021. This summarizes the skill set required for a person who is getting into data science

## Problem set
Comparing the current trends in machine learning and data science and comparing it with the previous year trends.
Analyzing the learning(student) community in data science and various distributions.
Inferring on how could a student get well equipped to get into industry

## Data Overview
This dataset has been formed by using kaggle survey. Students as well as working professionals were asked to participate in the survey . This dataset contains information on the gender and age of average kaggle user, their position in the tech world, and techniques and tools they use the most. Information on preference has also been considered.

## Methodology
Visualisation of data using various types of graphs such as bar graphs, pie charts get the maximum, get the range and average and do comparisons on the results obtained.For this purpose we have used various libraries like Seaborn, GGplot and matplotlib.The programming languages used are R and python

## Results
Today we see ML and DS usage in various fields ranging from Data Scientist to a developer relations
We saw the various skills(cloud, programming languages,ML algos, frameworks etc) that are in use in Data Science. 
Languages: Python,R, SQL
Cloud: AWS/Azure/GCP
Frameworks: scikit-learn/Keras/tensorFlow
Visualization: matplotlib/seaborn/ggplot
We also observed that the student community is well equipped with the demanded skills and the highest degree is bachelor’s(from the survey). 
We can observe that most of the industry working community holds a master’s degree
We observe that both in the students and industry, the major composition is of men and this gender disparity is really alarming.
The Internet (online platforms such as Coursera,YouTube,Kaggle), especially in today’s world, is the biggest tool and is playing a major role in education.
